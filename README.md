## WELCOME TO MY SUPER SECRET PROJECT CREATED BY PT (EST. 6/15/24)
	This project was created by Peyton "PT" Thompson on 6/15/2024 at 3:11pm EST. The goal of this project is get better. I will be documenting all of the updates and giving thoughts
		on certain decisions. Ive never kept docs before so im gonna try with this and see how it goes. You need to know that my grammar is not my strong suit and their WILL be mistakes, you can count on that. Did you notice the missspelled word in the previous sentence? It was "their" should be "there" obviously. LOL.

## TECH STACK (dev dependencies is probably more up to date lmfao)

	- You might be wondering why Im already deciding a tech stack when I dont know what I'm building. Ive been tinkering with the basics of react for awhile and its good at 
		building great UI. SASS or SCSS in this case is good because I've read that once css files get too big it can cause issues and the proccessing of scss files into a css files is better. Typescript because apprently its widely used in large codebases making it easier to maintain a larger code base. Finally React Router for navigation.

	THEME: Identical Sublime Text Monokai theme {I change all the time}
	ICON THEME: Material Icon Theme {this one I change only sometimes}

	EXTRA STUFF: Prettier, ES-LINT, babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining-assign, 

	FRONTEND:
		- REACT.JS
		- SASS
		- TYPESCRIPT
		- REACT ROUTER 
		- React three fiber


	BACKEND:
		- NOT DECIDED YES

SASS FILE TO CSS FILE CONVERSION
The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You‚Äôll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.
